                        exerciser demonstrating jumping rope
                        PETER ARDITO
                        High-intensity interval training (HIIT) is a great exercise format because you get the same results as endurance workouts in a fraction of the time. (And that's just one of the many benefits of HIIT.) Try incorporating it into your workout routine twice a week on alternate days.
                        
                         How to Use RPE to Improve Your Workouts
                        Choose any piece of cardio equipment such as an elliptical, jump rope, treadmill, or bike, then try these intervals (or opt for a bodyweight HIIT workout instead):
                        
                        3 minutes at 50 percent of your maximum effort
                        20 seconds at 75 percent of your maximum effort
                        10 seconds at your absolute maximum effort
                        Do 10 reps of the circuit.
